# vlcLEDtimer
Small windows Tool to display the remaining playtime of a VLC player as led display.

Created at a Event as helpful tool running on the video guys screen to see upcoming end of Video or Song.

Tool connect via TCP to VLC and display remaining playtime and play status of player so info PC can be different from playing PC. We also put it on the laptop of the stage manager to give him a rough info about time left.
